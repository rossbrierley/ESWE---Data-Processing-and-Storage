# ESWE---Data-Processing-and-Storage
## Setup and Running the Code
1. Clone or download the repository locally.
2. Compile the code using your C++ compiler. Example command:
  g++ -o inmemoryDB inmemoryDB.cpp
3. Run the program:
  ./inmemoryDB

## Future Modifications
To make this assignment an official part of the curriculum, consider clarifying edge cases, such as what happens if rollback() or commit() is called without any changes being made. Additionally, expanding the instructions to include multi-threaded scenarios would reflect real-world use cases and increase the challenge. Including automated test cases that validate functionality would standardize grading. Lastly, providing a basic example or skeleton implementation as a starting point could help students focus on the transactional logic without being overwhelmed by setup issues.
